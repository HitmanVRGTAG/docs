## What is Tricksurf?

A spinoff mode formed from the Combat Surf game mode, players can create and complete sequences of locations to surf to, known as tricks. Some tricks are harder than others, and some can be as easy as flicking off a ramp to a certain location, therefore ending the trick. People do these tricks for XP and bragging rights.

## History of Tricksurf

TrickSurf Began on https://zskyworld.com/, where a Surf/Combat Surf player known as Zee began posting his servers for tricksurfing. On zskyworld people posted tricks that they had made. Later on TrickSurfing began to die, Momentum Mod is bringing it back with the full relese of there game.

## How Tricksurf Works
